# nostrbook

Nostrbook is a throwback to 2008-era Facebook, powered by the Nostr protocol. It simplifies friend connections with "pending" and "accepted" lists. If you're both on each other's "pending" lists, you become friends. This system allows features like mutual friends, wall access, and posting on walls. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. 
Nostrbook: Bringing Social Media Back to Its Roots

Really, my goal with Nostrbook is to recapture the essence of social media from a simpler time. I want to rekindle the joy of adding your actual friends and family to stay connected in a more personal, genuine way, stepping away from the impersonal nature of modern social media to enjoy a more authentic online experience without instrusive ads and algorithms!

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
